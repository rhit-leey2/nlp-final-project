CSSE490 Natural Language Processing Final Project

Link to my final project paper : https://www.overleaf.com/read/xczgxphppxmk

The goal of the project is to recommend pills based on people's symptoms or medical condition. By using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the app will be able to analyze the input from the user and predict which pill would be most suitable for their needs. The aim of this project is to investigate the feasibility of using NLP to improve the accuracy of medical recommendations and reduce the likelihood of prescribing errors.
